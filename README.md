### Few Short learning: RetinaNet

Create a real-time object detection with a few examples using [RetinaNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002). 

Wouldnâ€™t it be frustrating if your smartphone needed to have thousands of pictures of you to recognize you and get unlocked? Thanks for the few-shot learning, this is not needed.

This technique has drawn a lot of attention in the research community and many solutions have been developed. To predict something based on a few training examples, the solutions right now use meta-learning or in three words: learning to learn.

If you want to learn how the few-shot detectors work, open the '*Few Shot Learning: RetinaNet.ipynb*' notebook and follow the steps to create your own  object detector and run it in real-time.
