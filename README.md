### Few-shot learning: Creating a real-time object detection using TensorFlow and Python

Fine tune a [RetinaNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002) to create a custom model.

Wouldnâ€™t it be frustrating if your smartphone needed to have thousands of pictures of you to recognize you and get unlocked? Thanks for the few-shot learning, this is not needed.

This technique has drawn a lot of attention in the research community and many solutions have been developed. To predict something based on a few training examples, the solutions right now use meta-learning or in three words: learning to learn.

RetinaNet is one of the most used few-shot learning convolution neural networks. In this repo, we are going to use TensorFlow and Python to fine tune this architecture and train a custom model.

If you want to learn how the few-shot detectors work, open the ['Few Shot Learning: RetinaNet.ipynb'](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11KAsKG6pTSUO-melYfCiohOVk4s6MwIB#scrollTo=PL8jmeQGKNT-) notebook and follow the steps to create your own  object detector and run it in real-time.
